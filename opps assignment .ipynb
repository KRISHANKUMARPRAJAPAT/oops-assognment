    "By using abstraction, we can separate the implementation details of a system from its interface, making it easier to change and maintain the system over time. Additionally, abstraction helps in creating more modular and reusable code, which can be used in different parts of an application or even in different applications altogether."

    "Here are some reasons why the abc module is commonly used in Python:\n",

    "Code reuse: Abstract base classes can define common interfaces for related classes, which can simplify code reuse and make it easier to write generic code that works with different classes that implement the same interface.\n",

    "Documentation: Abstract base classes can provide a clear and concise way to document the expected interface of a class or a module. By defining abstract methods and properties, you can clearly communicate what a class is supposed to do and what its requirements are.\n",
